We used Twitter Bootstrap.

We did all of the required features for a 4-person team. We also did the recommended features: achievements and administration.

Extensions:
- Newsfeed: displays a list of all of a user's friends' recent actions, sorted in chronological order. 
  This includes creating a quiz, taking a quiz, earning an achievement, and posting a status.
- User can post a status
- User can log out 
- Cookies: user can choose the "remember me" option when they log in ("Remember Me" is set to default). 
  By deselecting "Remember Me", the user removes their cookie, if it exists.
- Non-registered access: a user can log in as a guest. As a guest, a user can view other user profiles 
  and view quiz summary pages, but they cannot send messages, friend other users, earn achievements, or take/create quizzes.
- Users can delete note messages and challenge messages
- Users can directly reply to a note or challenge message
- Users can decline a friend request (and have the friend request message disappear from their inbox).
- Additional question type: multiple answer multiple choice (allows a user to check multiple check boxes)
- Quiz Editing:
	- You can't edit a quiz unless you're the creator of that quiz
	- Users can add a question
	- Users can remove a question
	- Users can modify an existing question, including changing the question String, and changing correct choices. 
	  For multiple-choice or multiple-choice-multiple-answer questions, users can change the potential choices. 
	  For picture-response questions, users can change the image URL. 

UI/UX:
- Dynamically update page according to question type
- Our achievements have custom icons
- Our site has a custom name: "Quizzler"
- Update the UI on a "friend profile" page to reflect whether or not the logged-in user has a pending friend 
  request for this person, can add this person as a friend, or remove this person as a friend
- Navigation bar at the top of all pages, that is fixed at the top:
	- Can search for users. 
	- Has an icon representing friends
	- Has an icon for messages
	- Has a drop-down menu for notifications, which displays the type of each notification and who it was from. 
	  Only displays the 7 most recent notifications. 
	- Notification drop-down turns red when a user has a new notification
	- Home link
	- User profile link
	- Log Out button
- Pop up modals on the homepage for recently created quizzes, popular quizzes, all existing quizzes, and a user-specific quiz history.
- Accept and Decline buttons listed next to friend request messages
- Send Reply Message and Delete Message buttons listed next to note messages and challenge messages
- Messages list and friend list appear in a neat table layout with hover enabled
- On their friends list page, there is a Send Message and Remove Friend button listed next to each friend, 
  so users can easily and direct message each person or remove each person as a friend.
- Newsfeed has a fixed height and a scrollbar

Error Checking:
- Make the user enter both a question and an answer for each question, (and choice if the question type 
  is multiple-answer-multiple-choice)
- A quiz has to have at least one question
- Don't allow the user to friend themselves or message themselves
- Cannot create multiple quizzes with the same name
- You cannot challenge someone to a quiz who is not your friend
- Don't allow multiple friend requests
- If a user searches for a profile that does not exist, displays a message accordingly.
- Quiz answers are case insensitive (So "george washington" is the same as "George Washington").
- We check the length of the URL for images (for picture-response questions) if itâ€™s going to be too long.
- You can't edit a quiz unless you're the creator of that quiz
- Question, answer, messages, image URL all have maximum 5,000 characters, rather than the standard 64 or 255.
